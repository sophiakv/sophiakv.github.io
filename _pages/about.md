<br>

I'm a 6th year AeroAstro PhD candidate and NSF Graduate Fellow in [STAR Lab](https://starlab.mit.edu/) at MIT. In short, my research interests include near-Earth asteroid detection, space-based telescopes, small satellites, and interstellar objects.

I received my B.A. in Physics from the University of Chicago in 2020, and my M.S. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from MIT in 2022.

My extracurricular interests include disability accessibility, LGBTQ+ inclusion, and STEM education outreach! I also enjoy skiing, rock climbing, hiking, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/186768911-sophia-vlahakis), learning American Sign Language (ASL), and [painting](https://www.instagram.com/soph_paints_stuff?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=MWd4M3U5aDRzZWJ4NA==).

I'm currently searching for postdoc/research positions (graduating May 2026). Please feel free to email me at **sophiakv {at} mit {dot} edu**, I'm happy to connect!
