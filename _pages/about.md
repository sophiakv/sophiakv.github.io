Hi! I am an AeroAstro PhD candidate in [STAR Lab](https://starlab.mit.edu/) at MIT. In short, my research interests include near-Earth asteroid detection, space-based telescopes, small satellites, and exoplanets.

My extracurricular interests include disability accessibility, LGBTQ+ inclusion, and STEM education outreach! I also enjoy skiing, rock climbing, hiking, reading, and painting.

Please feel free to shoot me an email at sophiakv {at} mit {dot} edu, I'd be happy to connect!
