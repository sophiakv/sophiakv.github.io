Hi! My name is Sophia K. Vlahakis, and I am a PhD student at [MIT STAR Lab](https://starlab.mit.edu/) under Professor Kerri Cahoy. In short, I work on small satellites and exoplanets.

This website is brand new and I will update it soon! You won't find any content in the other tabs yet.

If you're here, that likely means you got my business card at the 2022 Small Satellite Conference. I gave a talk as part of the Frank J. Redd Student Competition entitled ["On-Orbit Characterization of a Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) Deformable Mirror (DM) on the Deformable Mirror Demonstration Mission (DeMi) CubeSat."](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2022/all2022/5/)

Please feel free to shoot me an email at sophiakv {at} mit {dot} edu, I'd be happy to connect!
