### *This website is new and I'll update it soon! You won't find any content in the other tabs yet.*

Hi! I'm an AeroAstro PhD candidate and NSF Graduate Fellow in [STAR Lab](https://starlab.mit.edu/) at MIT. In short, my research interests include near-Earth asteroid detection, space-based telescopes, small satellites, and exoplanets.

I received my B.A. in Physics from The University of Chicago in 2020, and my M.S. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from the MIT in 2022.

My extracurricular interests include disability accessibility, LGBTQ+ inclusion, and STEM education outreach! I also enjoy skiing, rock climbing, hiking, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/186768911-sophia-vlahakis), learning American Sign Language (ASL), and painting (you can see some of my paintings [here](https://www.instagram.com/soph_paints_stuff?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=MWd4M3U5aDRzZWJ4NA==)).

Please feel free to shoot me an email at sophiakv {at} mit {dot} edu, I'd be happy to connect!
