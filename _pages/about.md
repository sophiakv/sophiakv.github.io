Hi! I'm a 6th year AeroAstro PhD candidate and NSF Graduate Fellow in [STAR Lab](https://starlab.mit.edu/) at MIT. In short, my research interests include near-Earth asteroid detection, space-based telescopes, small satellites, our solar system, and other solar systems.

I received my B.A. in Physics from The University of Chicago in 2020, and my M.S. in Aeronautics and Astronautics from the MIT in 2022.

My extracurricular interests include disability accessibility, LGBTQ+ inclusion, and STEM education outreach! I also enjoy skiing, rock climbing, hiking, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/186768911-sophia-vlahakis), learning American Sign Language (ASL), and painting (you can see some of my paintings [here](https://www.instagram.com/soph_paints_stuff?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=MWd4M3U5aDRzZWJ4NA==)).

Please feel free to email me at **sophiakv {at} mit {dot} edu**, I'm happy to connect!
