Hi! My name is Sophia K. Vlahakis, and I am a PhD student at [MIT STAR Lab](https://starlab.mit.edu/) under Professor Kerri Cahoy. In short, I work on small satellites and exoplanets.

This website is brand new and I will update it soon!

If you're here, that likely means you got my business card at SmallSat. I gave a talk as part of the Frank J. Redd Student Competition entitled ["On-Orbit Characterization of a Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) Deformable Mirror (DM) on the Deformable Mirror Demonstration Mission (DeMi) CubeSat."](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2022/all2022/5/)

Please feel free to shoot me an email at: sophiakv {at} mit {dot} edu, I'd be happy to chat.
