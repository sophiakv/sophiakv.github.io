<!-- excerpt: 'This paper is about the number 2. The number 3 is left for future work.' -->

When directly imaging exoplanetary systems with multiple planets, it can be unclear which detection belongs to which planet across different snapshots in time. This paper studies the prevalance of this problem, and describes a tool (the deconfuser) developed to reduce the rate of confusion.
