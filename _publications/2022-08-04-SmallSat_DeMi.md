<!-- excerpt: 'This paper is about the number 3. The number 4 is left for future work.' -->

In this paper, I describe analysis of on-orbit experiment data from the Deformable Mirror Demonstration Mission (DeMi) Cubesat, launched in 2020. These experiments characterized the successful on-board performance of the MEMS deformable mirror, measured using a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor.
