<!-- excerpt: 'Simulating capability of a potential space-based optical telescope to observe near Earth Asteroids' -->

In this paper, I describe simulatiions investigating the capability of a potential space-based optical telescope to observe near-Earth Asteroids, particularly to follow up on new discoveries by Rubin's LSST and NEO Surveyor.
